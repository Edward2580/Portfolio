This is just a little snippet of our Mern stack california speed card game, I was apart of a team of 4 software engineers and my role in
the creation of the game was to do the core game logic. I handled the win condition, creating the stages of the game, checking to see if 
there was a match on the board, and populating the MongoDB with a username,score, and a win/lose tag.
