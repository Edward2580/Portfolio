This is just a little snippet of a Mern stack california speed card game. I was apart of a team of 4 software engineers and my role in
the creation of the game was to do the core game logic. I handled the win condition, creating the stages of the game, checking to see if 
there was a match on the board, and populating the MongoDB with a username,score, and a win/lose tag. Click the following link to see the 
full code.

This is just a little snippet of a Mern stack hangman game. It was my job to create the logic for handling if a user has inputed a wrong
or correct guess.If the user's guess was wrong, then that character gets populated in a section below the hangman that will show the user
all of the incorrect guesses.On the other hand if they guessed it correctly, then the place where the correct word would show fills in
the spot where the correct character is at.Click the following link to see the  full code.
